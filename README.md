<p align="center"><i>A Disordered Flexible Linker (DFL) ppredictor trained on DLD domain Linker dataset and <a href="https://disprot.org/">Disprot</a> Database.</i></p>

## üìù Description
PUNCH_Linker project belongs to a serious of PUNCH projects which focus on the Structure and Function prediction of Intrisically Diordered Protein/Region (IDP/IDR).
Currently we have <a href="https://disprot.org/">PUNCH2</a> for IDR structure prediction and <a href="https://disprot.org/">PUNCH_Linker</a> for DFL prediction.
PUNCH_Linker is trained on more than 2000 DFL linker dataset from <a href="https://disprot.org/">DLD</a> dataset and <a href="https://disprot.org/">Disprot</a>, its performance is better than TOP predictors on the CAID2 Linker dataset.
