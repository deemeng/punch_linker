<p align="center"><i>A Disordered Flexible Linker (DFL) ppredictor trained on DLD domain Linker dataset and <a href="https://disprot.org/">Disprot</a> Database.</i></p>

## üìù Description
PUNCH_Linker project belongs to a serious of PUNCH projects which focus on the Structure and Function prediction of Intrisically Diordered Protein/Region (IDP/IDR).
Currently we have <a href="https://disprot.org/">PUNCH2</a> for IDR structure prediction and <a href="https://disprot.org/">PUNCH_Linker</a> for DFL prediction.
PUNCH_Linker is trained on more than 2000 DFL linker dataset from <a href="https://disprot.org/">DLD</a> dataset and <a href="https://disprot.org/">Disprot</a>, its performance is better than TOP predictors on the CAID2 Linker dataset.

## üê£ Getting Started
Currently, we provide two ways to use this perdictor: Docker or Download source code from this Github.
### Pre-requirements
This predictor requires sequences embedded with [ProtTrans](https://github.com/agemagician/ProtTrans) and [MSA Transformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm).
Note, 
* File format should be `[SEQUENCE_NAME/ID].npy`, replace *SEQUENCE_NAME/ID* with the actural sequence ID, it should be the same as the name from `.fasta` file.
* Matrix shape: \
  **Onehot**: (1, 227, 21) \
  **ProtTrans**: (1, 227, 1024) \
  **MSA Transformer**: (1, 227, 768)

üì£‚ÄºÔ∏èIf you don't have them available, please visit the **[embedding](https://github.com/deemeng/embedding)** section of our project first to embed the sequences.‚ÄºÔ∏è

(We maintain this separation due to the requirements from [CAID3](https://caid.idpcentral.org/challenge), but we may edit or merge them in the future.)
